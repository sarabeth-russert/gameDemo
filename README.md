# Game Demo

## Author: 
Sara Russert

## Description of Project: 
A demonstration of how to use Object Oriented Programing Principles in Game Design for Code Fellows Partner Power Hour

## Installing the Game Demo
git clone https://github.com/sarabeth-russert/gameDemo.git and run `npm install` in your command line. Please feel free to use this content as you wish and build upon it to create your own amazing games.

## Using the Game Demo
To run the Game open your terminal and navigate into the game folder you want to explore. The maze game is a very simply text based dungeon exploration game with only the concept of the space and the method of traversal sketched out. The RPG_preBuilt is a working example of the style of game we are building our demo with a very limited scope. The RPGDemo is the folder for the game we are building in the PPH.
- For the maze game, the start command is `node maze.js`. To build on or modify this game you can add additional characters, events, dialogue, or completely alter the game flow and goal!
- For the RPG pre-built game, the start command is `node game.js`. To build on or modify this game you can add additional characters, events, dialogue, or completely alter the game flow and goal!
